    <h2><div align="left">3 - Social Benefits</align></h1>
	<p>Video games weren't always meant to be played by only the person who bought the game. There are some games that encourage you to play with other people; these people being your friends, family, or even strangers.</p>
    
    <p>Many games can appeal to an entire audience and because of that, games can help families enjoy games together. It can also help bridge the gap between different generations. An example of this is when games, such as "Just Dance", have young kids dancing alongside their grandparents. Researchers have found that participants who had played "pro-social" games, in which characters must work together to help each other out, were more likely to engage in helpful behaviors in real life. Other games that were designed to teach and inform also have an impact because they help teach gamers about real-life issues, humanitarianism, and practical challenges that governments and organizations face today.</p>
    
    <p>Video games have emerged as a viable option for families to spend time together and can offer great benefits to families who are willing to enjoy them together. Besides social benefits, there are career benefits to video gaming.</p>
