	<h2><div align="left">4 - Career Benefits</align></h2>
	<p>Believe it or not, video games can even provide benefits that can help out in a career. A study argues that skills that can be learned while playing video games may undoubtedly be very valuable to students in the workforce of 2025. The Federation of American Scientists have proclaimed that kids actually need more time to play video games, not less.The reasoning behind this proclamation may not be seen right away, but it makes sense. Video games hold the potential to help address one of America's biggest problems: preparing students for an increasingly competitive global market.</p> 
    
    <p>Now, you might be wondering, how in the world are video games going to help students prepare for a global market? Well, video games can actually teach higher-order thinking skills. These higher-order thinking skills include strategic thinking, interpretative analysis, problem solving, plan formulation and execution, and adaptation of rapid change. These skills are ESSENTIAL in real life, especially in one's career. While there are other means of developing these skills besides playing video games, this is just one of the other ways to help develop these skills while having fun at the same time!</p>
