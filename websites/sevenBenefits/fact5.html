	<h2><div align="left">5 - Cooperation and Teamwork</align></h2>	
	<p>A valuable tool in life is the art of cooperating with a group of people to work towards a common goal. This has been a reoccurring theme in the real world recently with all the disasters and tragedies in the recent years. Video games are very good at helping a gamer grasp the concept of cooperation and teamwork.</p>
    
    <p>Many games today really emphasize on the cooperative aspects of game play, where players must work together to achieve a common goal. These games can help gamers encourage teamwork in real life and work together to develop better team work and collaborative skills. Some students even study the game development process as a way to build these skills.</p>
    
    <p>Many popular games help display the concept of teamwork. These games include the ever-popular Call of Duty series, World of Warcraft, and many others. Another benefit that video games provide is helping gamers stay fit and healthy.</p>
