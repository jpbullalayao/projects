	<h2><div align="left">1 - Educational Benefits</align></h2>
    
    
	<p>It may be hard to find any educational benefits at all in video games, simply because video games naturally have a bad reputation in attracting kids away from school and real life obligations. However, there actually are educational benefits. And believe it or not, this applies for all age groups.</p>
    
    <p>Many games were made for educational purposes. A study from the Education Development Center and the Ready to Learn (RTL) Initiative discovered that a curriculum that involved digital media, like video games, has the potential to improve literacy skills when this is coupled with strong parental and teacher involvement. Not only that, but a study that focused on 4-5 year olds also showed increases in letter recognition, sounds association with letters, and understanding basic concepts about stories and print. However, these are a result of parents and teachers that were equally invested in this way of learning.</p>
    
    <p>This does not only help children, however. Even adults can benefit from video games. Research has shown that video games can help adults process information much faster and help improve their abilities to reason and solve problems. Other studies have shown that gamers perform 10%-20% higher in perceptual and cognitive ability than non-game players. Finally, games can also help improve hand-eye coordination, enhance split-second decision making, and boost auditory peception. What's the next benefit in video gaming? Improved multitasking.</p>
