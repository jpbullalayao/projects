	<h2><div align="left">7 - Building Confidence</align></h1>
	<p>In many ways, video games can help a gamer feel a sense of accomplishment and consequently build self-confidence. Confidence is an essential state of mind in real life when you need to perform a task and/or solve a problem.</p>
    
    <p>Researchers have created and tested computer games that are specifically designed to help people enhance their self-acceptance. This is accomplished by having gamers play repetitive computer games that would help people feel more positive about themselves, and this can be accomplished even without games that aren't specifically designed to enhance self-acceptance. Any player can feel a sense of accomplishment in any game. This is because all games were meant to be beaten. Though, you don't have to beat an entire game just to be successful. Most games are designed to introduce a concept, and then provide players with an opportunity to master it. In this way, players are free to explore, utilize, and achieve success with this concept and at the same time build their self-confidence and feel accomplished at the end when they finally do succeed.</p>
