        <p>Originally released as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green in Japan, Pokémon Red and Blue became the first installments in the Pokémon franchise and subsequently became a success internationally after its release outside of Japan. The game introduced 151 Pokémon and would take place in the Kanto region. Following the debuts of Red and Blue, a newer version, Yellow, was made and saw various improvements and changes; most notably, having Pikachu physically follow your player during your journey (much like in the anime).</p>

            <p>Nintendo would continue its success with the release of the third generation installments: Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. 135 new species of Pokémon were introduced and subsequently brought the total count of Pokémon species to 386.

            <p>This generation also saw the GameBoy Advance remakes of Pokémon Red and Blue from Generation I, and were renamed Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen.

            <p>Pokémon Diamond and Pearl debuted as the fourth generation installments in the franchise. 107 new species of Pokémon debuted in this generation and a total of 493 Pokémon existed at this point.

            <p>This generation, much like the other, also saw the remakes of previous games, namely, Pokémon Gold and Silver. The remakes debuted a few years after Diamond and Pearl as HeartGold and SoulSilver, and introduced new features (and the ability to transfer Pokémon from newer generations that debuted AFTER Gold/Silver) that were not previously in the regular Gold/Silver games.</p>

            <p>Adding a new twist in the series, Pokémon Black and White became the fifth generation installments in the franchise. Unlike previous games, where the regions were based off different areas of Japan, the region of Unova (where the game takes place) is largely based off the city of New York and its surrounding areas. "Unova" also may have been derived from <b>Un</b>ited States <b>of</b> <b>A</b>merica. In this generation, 156 new Pokémon were introduced (however, a few are not available yet), totalling the count to 649 Pokémon species. This generation would also mark the first time where direct sequels (rather than updated, newer "versions") are going to be made for the franchise. Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 are scheduled to release later on this year (2012).</p>
